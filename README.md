- Computer player using minimax method.
- Player clicks upon slots make an explosion noise.
- Line through four chips showing a clear and decisive winner.
- Player clicks upon slots register anywhere on the board and "drop" a chip, not just from the top row of slots.
- Upon loss against the computer or time running out, a gif of an explosion appears, ending the game.
- Game board rotates and artificial gravity is implemented, making chips fall out of the board as the player tries to connect four. Player can click on game chips to prevent them from falling out. This will be a difficulty level.
- Make responsive to all devices and breakpoints.
